# A Novel Approach to Quantifying Zone Exits

## Overview
This repository contains the source files for the paper *"A Novel Approach to Quantifying Zone Exits"* by Arun Ramji and Ethan Batiuk. The paper introduces a sequence-aware Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict successful zone exits in ice hockey, analyzing play sequences to quantify player contributions and provide actionable insights for team strategies. Using event data from Linköping University, the model achieves an accuracy of 0.7818 and a ROC-AUC of 0.9328. A novel player rating metric based on expected shot generation is also proposed.



## Requirements
To run the scripts, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `collections`, `torch`, `json`, `scipy`, `itertools`, `random`

## Data
The dataset from Linköping University, containing hockey event data, is not included due to privacy restrictions.
